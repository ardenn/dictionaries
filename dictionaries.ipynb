    "The python programming language implements a number of data structures natively. Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries are but some of them. We will be looking at the dictionary data type in subsequent sections.\n",

    "A dictionary in python is a mapping object that maps keys to values, where the keys are unique within a collection and the values can hold any arbitrary value. In addition to being unique, keys are also required to be hashable. An object is said to be hashable if it has a hash value (implemented by a `__hash__()` method) that does not change during the object’s lifetime. Most commonly, we use immutable data types, such as strings, integers, and tuples (only if they contain similarly immutable types) as dictionary keys. A dictionary’s data is always enclosed by a pair of curly braces `{ }`.\n",

    "Unlike sequenced data types like lists and tuples, where indexing is achieved using positional indices, dictionaries are indexed using their keys. Therefore, individual values can be accessed using these keys.\n",
    "### How similar are dictionaries to other data structures in other languages?\n",
    "Dictionaries are an implementation of [Associative Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array). All Associative arrays have a structure of (key, value) pairs, where each key is unique for every collection. Other languages also have similar executions, such as:\n",

    "- std::map in C++\n",
    "- Maps in Java\n",
    "- JavaScript objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases of dictionaries\n",
    "Typically dictionaries are used to store associative data, i.e data that is related. Examples include:\n",
    " - The attributes of an object.\n",
    " - A row of `SQL` data.\n",
    " \n",

    "Dictionaries come in very handy for regular python usage. They are suitable for use with unordered data that relies on relations. Caution should however be exercised to ensure we do not use dictionaries in the wrong way and end up slowing down execution of our code. For further reading please refer to the official python documentation on [mapping types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)."
