    "### What are python dictionaries \n",
    "A dictionary in python is a mapping object that maps keys to values, where the keys are unique within a dictionary and the values can hold any arbitrary value. In addition to being unique, keys are also required to be hashable. An object is said to be hashable if it has a hash value (implemented by a `__hash__()` method) that doesn’t change during the object’s lifetime. Most commonly, we use immutable data types, such as strings, integers, and tuples (only if they contain similarly immutable types) as dictionary keys. A dictionary’s data is always enclosed by a pair of curly braces `{ }`.\n",
    "Typically dictionaries look like this."

    "### How different are dictionaries from other common data structures in python\n",
    "Unlike sequenced data types like lists and tuples where indexing is achieved using the positional indices - which is a range of integers, dictionaries are indexed using their keys. As a result individual values can be accessed using these keys.\n",
    "### How similar are dictionaries to other data structures in other languages\n",
    "Like lists, tuples and sets, dictionaries are iterable i.e they can be looped through. Dictionaries are also mutable since they can be modified in place, just like lists and sets.\n",
    "### Use cases of dictionaries\n",
    "Typically dictionaries are used to store associative data, i.e data that is related. Examples include:\n",
    " - The attributes of an object.\n",
    " - A row of data from an `SQL` table.\n",
    "In this particular scenario, we will be using using dictionaries to store job listing details from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ardenn/brighter-monday-job-listings/data)\n",
